    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm from Montville, New Jersey. I'll be attending Carnegie Mellon Univeristy in the Fall. I love playing and watching most sports.</p>
    <p>I've always loved math and science, so I'm very excited to study Computer Science in CSSI and in college.</p>
    <p>I played tennis on my school's varsity tennis team for all four years. This is me as an awkward freshman.</p>
